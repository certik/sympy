Formula Manipulation
====================

SymPy handles formulas of all types, from polynomials to complex combinations
of higher mathematical functions. It provides powerful general transformation
and simplification functions that automatically call on thousands of rules and
algorithms.

Simplify -- simplify, perhaps with assumptions about variables
FullSimplify -- apply full simplification procedures
