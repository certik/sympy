List Manipulation
=================

Lists are central constructs in Python+SymPy, used to represent collections,
arrays, sets and sequences of all kinds. Lists can have any structure and size,
and can routinely involve even millions of elements. Well over a dozens
built-in functions throughout SymPy and Python operate directly on lists, making
lists a powerful vehicle for interoperability.
