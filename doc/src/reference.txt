SymPy Reference
===============

This guide is a translation of the excellent `Mathematica documentation
center <http://reference.wolfram.com/>`_ to Python+SymPy. This reference is
meant as 1:1 translation, so if there is a missing feature in SymPy, there is
always a link to the corresponding issue in our bugtracker. Correspondigly, if
SymPy can do something that Mathematica cannot, it should be added to a special
section, or in our other docs.

All of the examples are executed directly in :ref:`isympy <isympy>` and you are
encouraged to try them yourself.
